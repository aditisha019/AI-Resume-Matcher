# AI-Resume-Matcher
An AI-powered tool to analyze resume-job description fit, built for recruiters and job seekers to optimize hiring and career success.
📌 Project Description
AI Resume Matcher is a full-stack application that evaluates how well a candidate's resume matches a given job description using advanced semantic similarity models and GPT-based resume suggestions.

This project targets real-world challenges faced during job applications:

Are you applying to jobs that actually match your resume?

What skills are missing for the role?

How can you modify your resume to increase interview chances?

With an intuitive UI and powerful AI backend, this app delivers:

✅ A match score (0–100)

✅ A skills gap analysis

✅ GPT-based improvement suggestions for resumes

Built with a modern tech stack and optimized for high-performance AI processing, this project reflects months of effort in AI development, full-stack integration, and real problem-solving.

💡 Key Features
Feature	Description
📄 Resume & JD Upload	Paste or upload resumes and job descriptions
🧠 Semantic Similarity	Uses MiniLM transformer to evaluate text embeddings
📊 Match Score	Displays a percentage match based on semantic closeness
🛠️ Skills Gap Analysis	Highlights missing and overlapping skills
🤖 GPT Resume Coach	Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to rewrite summaries and bullet points
🌐 Frontend Interface	Clean React UI for easy interaction
🚀 FastAPI Backend	Python-based REST API handling NLP & GPT tasks
📦 GitHub + Colab	Modular, cloud-friendly dev structure
